MIRA warncode: READGROUP_UNEXPECTED_PAIRS
Title: Unexpected pairs in readgroup

In readgroup 2 (named: 'new_junction') paired reads were found but no pairing
information given in the manifest. MIRA will estimate 'template_size' and
'segment_placement'.
You can suppress this warning by using the keyword 'autopairing' in the
readgroup definition of the manifest file.

MIRA warncode: READ_NAME_TOO_LONG
Title: Long read names

73371 reads were detected with names longer than 40 characters (see output log
for more details).

While MIRA and many other programs have no problem with that, some older
programs have restrictions concerning the length of the read name.

Example given: the pipeline
     CAF -> caf2gap -> gap2caf
will stop working at the gap2caf stage if there are read names having > 40
characters where the names differ only at >40 characters.

This is a warning only, but as a couple of people were bitten by this, the
default behaviour of MIRA is to stop when it sees that potential problem.

You might want to rename your reads to have <= 40 characters. Instead of
renaming reads in the input files, maybe the 'rename_prefix' functionality of
manifest files is useful for you there.

On the other hand, you also can ignore this potential problem and force MIRA to
continue by using the parameter: '-NW:cmrnl=warn' or '-NW:cmrnl=no'
